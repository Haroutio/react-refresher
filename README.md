# React Refresher

This will be the third video tutorial I will be following, which is Traversy Medias ReactJS Crash Course on YouTube. With the documentation and a notebook by my side, I'm hoping to push through and go through this tutorial as much as I need to in order to fully process what each line of code is doing. After this tutorial I'm going to jump right into just building a bunch of React projects. Unfortunately, being away from web development has made me very rusty. So much so, that I barely remember anything from React and it simply looks unfamiliar. I'll be focusing solely on React for the time being and will aim at building a few projects after this tutorial, seeing as it's my weakest link as of right now.
