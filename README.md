# React Refresher

This will be the third video tutorial I will be following, which is Traversy Medias ReactJS Crash Course on YouTube. With the documentation and a notebook by my side, I'm hoping to push through and go through this tutorial as though I'm a beginner. A lot has changed since I worked with React.

UPDATE: After completing this tutorial, it's become clear that time is the enemy and a lot has changed. Overall it seems pretty simple once you get going and making changes becomes a breeze. I'll be working on some react projects after this to get some practice hours in.
